PLAYX LICENSE AGREEMENT

License copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 

Preamble 

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. 

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. 

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". 

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. 

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. 

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. 

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 

NO WARRANTY 

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

In the event that Licensee, at its sole discretion, decides to use Khrona's Trademarks, Khrona hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use, including the right to sublicense, the Trademarks in conjunction with Licensee’s marketing, advertising, manufacturing information, and product packaging activities.
            2.4.1 Non-Assignment.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the trademark rights granted to Licensee by and obtained by Licensee as a result of or in connection with this Agreement are license rights only, and nothing contained in this Agreement constitutes or shall be construed to be an assignment of any or all of Khrona's rights in the Trademarks.  All goodwill associated with such activities of Licensee shall inure to the benefit of the Khrona.
            2.4.2 Quality of Product.  In the event Licensee decides to use Khrona's Trademarks, Licensee agrees to maintain a high quality of any Licensed Product provided under the Trademark consistent with the quality of previous versions of Khrona's products as of the Effective Date and consistent with a standard that ensures the continued protection of the Trademark and the goodwill pertaining to the Trademark.  In such an event, Khrona reserves the right to receive samples of the mark as used in conjunction with the Licensed Product no more than once per year or as reasonably provided by Licensee, to ensure that the quality meets the foregoing standard.
            2.4.3 Trademark Format.  Licensee shall only use or display the Trademark in a format approved by Khrona, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
            2.4.4 Proper Notice and Acknowledgment.  Every use of the Trademark by Licensee shall incorporate in an appropriate manner a "TM" or once it is registered an "R" enclosed by a circle or the phrase "Reg. U.S. Trademark of Khrona LLC".
            2.4.5 Impairment of Khrona's Rights.  If Licensee decides to use the Trademark, Licensee shall not at any time, whether during or after the Term of this Agreement, do or cause to be done any act or thing challenging, contesting, impairing, invalidating, or tending to impair or invalidate any of Khrona's rights in the Trademark or any registrations derived from such rights.
            2.4.6 Khrona's Rights and Remedies.  If Licensee decides to use the Trademark, Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Khrona has, shall retain and may exercise, both during the Term of this Agreement and thereafter, all rights and remedies available to Khrona, whether derived from this Agreement, from statute, or otherwise, as a result of or in connection with Licensee's breach of the trademark license granted in this Agreement, misuse of the Trademark or any other use of the Trademark by Licensee which is not permitted by this Agreement.
ARTICLE 3 

RESTRICTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS
      3.1 Restrictions.  All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by Khrona.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be interpreted to give Licensee any rights with respect to any copyrights, patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property, including software by Khrona other than Awesomium software under the terms described herein.
      3.2 Ownership of Intellectual Property.  As between Khrona and Licensee, Khrona owns and shall continue to own all intellectual property rights in the Awesomium software.  Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to grant Khrona any rights to Licensee's Licensed Products, except as expressly stated herein.
      3.3 Interest in Improvements.  Khrona shall own all intellectual property rights and all other property rights in new patent applications and Improvements which Khrona makes to the Awesomium software, including using information received from Licensee or while performing Khrona's obligations under the terms of this Agreement.  Licensee hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to Khrona, and the Khrona hereby accepts and assumes, free and clear of and from encumbrances, all right, title and interest, together with all rights of priority, in and to such Improvements and the patent(s) that may issue from such Improvements, and including the subject matter of all claims that may be obtained therefrom, any foreign counterparts or equivalents thereto, existing now or in the future, and any and all divisionals, continuations (in whole or in part), reissues, renewals and extensions of any of the foregoing, any substitutions therefore and any patents that may issue from the foregoing, the same to be held and enjoyed by Khrona for its own use and benefit, and for the use and benefit of its successors or assigns, to the end of the term or terms for which said patents are or may be granted or reissued, as fully and entirely as the same would have been held and enjoyed by the Licensee if this assignment had not been made.  Such assignment includes, without limitation, all income, royalties, damages or payments due or payable after the Effective Date related to any of the foregoing and all claims for damages by reason of past, present or future infringement or other unauthorized use of the foregoing, with the right to sue for and collect the same.  Licensee hereby authorizes and requests the Commissioner of Patents of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or any equivalent body in any foreign jurisdiction, to record this assignment so as to reflect Khrona’s ownership of the Improvements.  Licensee hereby covenants and agrees that the Licensee will, at any time, upon request, execute and deliver any and all papers and take any and all other reasonable actions that may be necessary or desirable to implement or perfect this assignment, without further compensation but at the expense of the assignee, its successors or assigns with respect to Licensee’s reasonable out-of-pocket costs.
      3.4 Protection of Improvements.  Khrona shall prepare, file, prosecute, obtain, maintain and enforce any or all intellectual property rights in, to, and under the Improvements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Khrona shall be under no obligation to prosecute or pursue intellectual property protection, in, to or under any Improvements inside or outside of the United States.
ARTICLE 4 

CERTAIN LICENSEE OBLIGATIONS
      4.1 No Reverse Engineering.

            8.1.1 any breach of Licensee's obligations in ARTICLE 4; or 
            8.1.2 any breach of the confidentiality obligations under ARTICLE 9 by Licensee, its Affiliates, employees, or contractors; or
            8.1.3 any third-party claim of infringement or misappropriation that arises out of the Licensed Product due to use of the Awesomium software in combination with Licensee's software or technology.

      8.3 Party Seeking Indemnification.  (a) If either Party seeks indemnification under the terms of this ARTICLE 8 (the "Indemnified Party") against the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the third party claim or threatened third party claim it receives notice thereof, shall permit the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's cost and expense, to assume direction and control of the defense of the third party claim, and shall cooperate as requested (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party), in the defense of the claim.

ARTICLE 9 

CONFIDENTIALITY
      9.1 Non-use and Non-disclosure.  Each Party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose except for the purposes set forth in this Agreement.  Each Party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party, except that, subject to Section 9.2 below, a receiving Party may disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information (except Source Code unless otherwise specified in writing) to those employees of the receiving Party who are required to have the information for the purposes set forth in this Agreement, and relevant consultants, provided that the receiving Party first obtains a signed confidentiality agreement with terms similar to this Agreement from the consultants, such that consultants are under a confidentiality obligation to the receiving Party.  If a receiving Party is required by law to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise constrained by this Agreement, the receiving Party will provide the disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief.  Subject to the foregoing sentence, such receiving Party may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that the receiving Party is legally compelled or is otherwise legally required to disclose; provided, however, that the receiving Party provides such reasonable assistance as the disclosing Party may request in obtaining such order or other relief.
      9.2 Maintenance of Confidentiality.  Each Party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other Party.  Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no case less than reasonable care (including, without limitation, all precautions the receiving Party employs with respect to its confidential materials).  Prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees, each Party shall ensure that such employees who have access to the other Party’s Confidential Information have signed a non-disclosure agreement in content similar to the provisions of this Agreement or are otherwise legally obligated not to disclose such Confidential Information.  Each Party shall reproduce the other Party’s proprietary rights notices on any photo or electronic copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.  A Party receiving Confidential Information shall promptly notify the Party disclosing such Confidential Information of any use or disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement of which the receiving Party becomes aware.
      9.3 Source Code.  For purposes of clarity, any Source Code may not be disclosed by a receiving Party to any third party, including consultants under non-disclosure agreements, without the prior written consent of the disclosing Party.
      9.4 Limitation on Copying.  Other than Khrona's rights in the Improvements, the disclosing Party retains and owns all copyrights, rights in derivative works in the Confidential Information and the receiving Party hereby agrees not to copy the Confidential Information, in whole or in part, except as is necessary to perform its tasks under this Agreement.
      9.5 Return of Materials.  All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information that have been disclosed by either Party to the other Party, shall be and remain the property of the disclosing Party and shall be promptly returned to the disclosing Party upon the disclosing Party’s written request.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, one (1) copy of any written or photographic Confidential Information provided by the other Party may be retained by the receiving Party for archival purposes only.
      9.6 Duration.  The confidentiality obligations of each receiving Party under this Agreement shall survive until such time as all Confidential Information of the other Party disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known and made generally available through no action or inaction of the receiving Party.  The obligations to hold information in confidence as required by ARTICLE 9 also shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
      9.7 Duty to Notify of Confidentiality Breach.  Either Party shall immediately provide written notice to the other Party of any breach of this ARTICLE 9, specifying the specific nature of the breach.  The breaching Party shall then have thirty (30) days to reasonably cure the breach.  Should such breach not be reasonably cured within sixty (60) days from receipt of such notice, then the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement.
      9.8 Availability of Equitable Relief.  Each Party understands and agrees that its breach or threatened breach of this Agreement will cause irreparable injury to the other Party and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy for such breach or threatened breach, and both parties hereby agree that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching Party will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance.  The Parties’ rights under this Agreement are cumulative, and a Party’s exercise of one right shall not waive the Party’s right to assert any other legal remedy.
ARTICLE 10
